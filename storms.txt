Some storms are garden variety. These smol baby convective cells are called airmass/ordinary thunderstorms.

Some storms contain robust persistant rotating mesocyclones contained within the updraft of the parent convective cell. 
These convective rotating cells are called supercells. 
Supercells are the type of convective cell that produces tornadoes. 
Tornadoes come in all shapes and sizes. 
Some tornadoes are huge condensed wejj's like the Minden-Harlan, IA EF3.
Some tornadoes are cute, beautiful high base ropes/stove pipes like the Silverton, TX EFU's.
Some tornadoes are sad, rain-wrapped funnels you cannot see. :( 

Tornadogenesis is the process in which tornadoes are produced. 
Signs tornadogenesis is occuring includes a horseshoe vortex indicating vorticity is being stretched into the vertical.
